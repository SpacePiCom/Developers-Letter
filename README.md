# An Open Letter to the SpacePi Community

## Dear SpacePi Community Members

With deep gratitude, we extend our sincere greetings to all friends who care about and support SpacePi. Today, the developer team would like to take this opportunity to share the project's journey, challenges, future plans, and expectations for the community.

## Project Background and Vision

SpacePi, as a unique meme token, draws its name from SpaceX and Pi, symbolizing technology and innovation, and embodying a hopeful vision for the future. Since the project's inception, our vision has always been to make SpacePi a landmark project that leads in technology and cultural heritage, becoming a shining star in the blockchain world.

In this rapidly developing era, the integration of technology and culture is the trend of the future. The uniqueness of SpacePi lies in the fact that it is not only a cryptocurrency but also a cultural symbol representing innovation, exploration, and infinite possibilities. Through SpacePi, we hope to inspire developers and enthusiasts worldwide to participate in this vibrant ecosystem.

## Recent Progress

In recent times, the community has made significant strides in operations and market promotion. Through a series of marketing activities and promotional efforts, the community has continued to grow, with an increasing number of users and activity levels. Additionally, SpacePi has partnered with several exchanges to jointly promote the application and development of blockchain technology. These efforts have not only increased SpacePi's visibility but also laid a solid foundation for future development.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

Technically, SpacePi (ETH/BSC) has a total supply of 2,000 trillion, posing significant challenges for cross-chain technology. During the research on Wormhole technology, SpacePi encountered conflicts between supply and SOL token limitations. Despite this, after discussions with core community members, it was decided to burn SpacePi (ETH/BSC) and mint SpacePi (SOL) on the SOL chain. Throughout this process, we will ensure fair treatment of all holders (including the developer team) without any additional issuance. Theoretically, the total supply of SpacePi (SOL) will not exceed 180 trillion, while the burn volume of SpacePi (ETH/BSC) will far exceed this number, potentially reaching over 300 trillion.

Promoting decentralization and achieving broader community participation has always been SpacePi's goal. To this end, the developer team has decided to fully open source the SpacePi (ETH/BSC) website code on June 28, 2024. This is not just a technological advancement but also a symbol of SpacePi granting more autonomy to the community. Through open source, we hope that every developer and user passionate about SpacePi can find their place on this platform, contributing their wisdom and strength. The collective wisdom and diverse participation of the community will make SpacePi's future brighter.

The future development cannot rely solely on the efforts of a few developers. Projects like Doge and Shiba have achieved their current success because of broad community participation and support. Only with the collective efforts of community members can SpacePi usher in a brighter future.

## Ecosystem Collaboration and Openness

After the issuance of SpacePi (SOL), price differences will theoretically still exist across the three chains. Due to the inability to achieve bidirectional cross-chain, even if technically feasible, factors such as liquidity pools, users, and the market will prevent prices from fully balancing. In the short term, price differences may be hard to eliminate. The developer team will continue to work with the community in the future to find more solutions to this problem. Only when prices across multiple chains become consistent can all SpacePi users unite to push SpacePi further.

We eagerly look forward to more developers joining the SpacePi ecosystem to create more DApps and other ecosystem applications, including Layer2. SpacePi ecosystem partner pi.space is developing more Pi Metaverse Telegram games for SpacePi, bringing more empowerment to SpacePi tokens and their NFTs in the future.

To promote the construction of SpacePi's ecosystem, community members should actively seek collaborations with other blockchain projects, technology companies, and community organizations. By establishing a broad network of cooperation, we hope to gather more resources and wisdom to jointly advance SpacePi's development.

## Expressing Sincere Emotions

Dear community members, SpacePi's growth cannot be achieved without your support and trust. Your likes, shares, and suggestions are the driving force behind the progress of the SpacePi community. We sincerely thank you for your companionship and encouragement along the way. It is because of you that the SpacePi community can overcome one difficulty after another and continue to move forward.

SpacePi sincerely invites every community member to join the community and work together for SpacePi's future. The future of SpacePi belongs to the community, and everyone can develop and innovate on its foundation.

Finally, thank you again to every community member who supports and cares about SpacePi. Your trust and support are the greatest motivation for the community to keep moving forward. The SpacePi community promises to continue advancing the SpacePi project with an open, transparent, and responsible attitude, living up to everyone's expectations.

**Thank you for your support and trust!**
